; All ships start full:
; with their respective maximum: energy, recharge, thruster, speed, rotation, gun level, bomb level
; and with their respective utilities: stealth, x-radar, anti-warp, cloak
; and with their respective items
;
; However, they lack: bouncing bullets, multifire, proximity bombs/mines, and shrapnel
; because there are no such ship settings to start initially with these.
; We want all ships to start with them.
; These weights pretty much ensure that all ships receive them, given sufficiently high enough starting bounties.
; Note: ShrapnelRate is also set such that ships will get to ShrapnelMax with just a single Shrapnel prize.
;
; Other notes:
; 1. There are no greens (prizes) on the map. So this is not being used for that purpose.
; 2. Purposely no items (repel, burst, decoy, thor, portal, brick, rocket) from regular prizes. So, starting ships will not randomly get items.
;    This allows us to know exactly how many items a newly spawned ship has and adjust accordingly for sub-ins.
